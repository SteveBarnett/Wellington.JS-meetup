## Help!

We would love to help you and offer guidance on putting together a talk (or a workshop). We’ll be with you every step of the way that you’d like help with, on the iterative feedback process. We’ll help by being an appreciative and supportive audience that will provide constructive feedback to help you get ready.

Want to talk something through? [Contact us](https://www.meetup.com/WellingtonJS/members/?op=leaders) and we’ll find time for a chat on the phone, Skype, or Hangouts. We're happy to answer any questions you have.

The [Wellington.JS organising team](https://www.meetup.com/WellingtonJS/members/?op=leaders) are experienced speakers and workshop runners and will help you throughout the iterative feedback steps of preparing.

- **Deciding on a theme.** What are you interested in? What do you want to find out more about?
- **Thinking of the elevator pitch.** What makes an in interesting story?
- **Putting together an outline.** Bullet points FTW! What's the one main point you want to get across, and how do you start and end?
- **Making slides.** Making your own, or [using a template](http://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/how-to-do-ok-at-slides).
- **Practising the talk** We’ll be an appreciative and supportive audience that will provide constructive feedback.

## “But I’m a newbie!”

We welcome people from all experience and knowledge levels!

If you’re new to speaking, we are [happy to help](#help). If you already know about a topic are passionate about it, we’ll help you put together a talk or workshop on your favourite front-end thing. Speaking can be scary at first, but it’s very rewarding to share your knowledge.

If you’re new to front-end, we want to hear from you! You can help show other people like you that it’s not as scary and confusing as it looks: everyone has to start somewhere. If you’ve just learned something you are the best person to tell others about it: you know the things to look out for, and what’s unexpected. Giving a talk about a topic is a great excuse to dig into learning about it.

[Get in touch](https://www.meetup.com/WellingtonJS/members/?op=leaders) and tell us about the story you'd like to share.
